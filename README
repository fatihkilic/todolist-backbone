This is a simple todo list. 
I have used the Backbone JS, Node JS, MongoDB, Mongoose, Mocha and Jsdoc tool.

Attention please!
This application using port number 3000 -please ensure that the port is available- and assume that mongodb has been already running on port number 27017.
Otherwise, the program will not run.

If you have provided these requirements, you should run following commands:

> npm install 
> npm start

You can access the application http://localhost:3000 

On the other hand, if you want to run test cases, you should run "npm test" from another command line.

You can use jsdoc for like this: "./node_modules/.bin/jsdoc -c conf.json" then you can find output the docs/ folder.

The version of the tools are as follows:
node version is 6.9.2
npm is 3.10.9
mongodb is 2.4.9

Thanks,
Fatih
